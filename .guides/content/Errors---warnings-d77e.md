Flode detects errors in your chart. 

## Warnings
Warnings are highlighted in orange. These mean that your code will run up to that point but not beyond. The most common cases for warnings are

- you reference a variable that has not yet been created
- a Condition block does not have 2 outgoing connections (1 for true and 1 for false)

Hover over the offending block to get the precise warning details.

## Errors
Syntax errors are highlighted in red. Hover over the offending block to get the precise error details.

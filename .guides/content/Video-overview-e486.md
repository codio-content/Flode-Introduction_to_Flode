This unit contains reference pages on how to use Flode but the video below is a great way of getting an overview to begin with.

Again, don't worry too much about understanding all the details but concentrate on how the chart is being built and how blocks and lines are added.

You may want to refer to this once you learn more about building Flode charts.

We suggest you blow this up to full screen.

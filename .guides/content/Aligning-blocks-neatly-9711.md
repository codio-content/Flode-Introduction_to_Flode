To speed up the editing process, you can add your blocks quickly without worrying too much about aligning them until later.

Multi-select the blocks that you want to align, then right click on one of the selected blocks then select 'Align vertically' or 'Align horizontally'. 

You should only try to align blocks that are roughtly above one another **or** alongside one another. If you have blocks in both directions then do one direction first and the other in a second step.

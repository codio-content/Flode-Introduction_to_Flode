Flode is a flowcharting application with a difference. With other flowcharting applications you can design your flowchart but with Flode you can actually run the Flowchart like a program.

Flode is a great way of learning about basic algorithms and computational thinking. It is especially useful for preparing to learn programming languages like Javascript or Python.

## Example
Don't worry about what is going on in the Flode chart below. The main thing to look at is that you can easily construct a chart like this. Just concentrate on the fact that there are different 'blocks', lines joining the blocks and some comments.

Each block type has a different meaning and behavior. We'll talk about these on the following pages.

## Steps
Imagine yourself starting with the 'Start' block. As we will see later, Flode execution starts with this block and then moves along the arrows to the next one and so on.

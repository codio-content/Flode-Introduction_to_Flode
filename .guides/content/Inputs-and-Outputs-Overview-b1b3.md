Inputs and Outputs are important when doing the many challenges you will find in the Flode Units. 

A challenge may require none, one or more input blocks depending on what the challenge is asking you to do. A challenge will almost always  expect at least one output.

## Inputs
An input is a value that the challenge passes into your chart and you should work with in some way.

## Outputs
An output is data that your challenge sends back to the challenge to evaluate.

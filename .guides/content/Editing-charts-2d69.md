Here's a quick summary of the available block types. These are described in more details on the following pages.

- **Operation** is where you write instructions such as `x = 24` or `str = input0 + ', hello'`.
- **Condition** is how you handle 'if' type conditions.
- **Input** manages inputs from a challenge.
- **Output** is how you output results from your flow chart to a challenge (and to the output console).
- **Hub** is a simple visual connector.
- **Debug** is a way of writing messages of expressions to the output console.
- **End** tells Flode to end program execution.

## Aligning nodes
If you have multi-selected blocks, you can then align them. To do so, select some blocks that appear above one another, then right-click on one of the selected blocks, then select 'Align vertically'. For blocks that are laid out next to one another, multi-select those blocks and then press 'Align horizontally' after right clicking.
